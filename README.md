### About Me

I am currently working as Solutions Developer at Deloitte. I have pursued Master of Science in Computing from Griffith College Dublin. I worked with Capgemini for 3.1 years where I gained a strong knowledge on functionality modules, implementation, and quality management processes. I have also completed my bachelor’s degree focused on Information Technology from Vidyavardhini’s College of Engineering and Technology (affiliated by Mumbai University). I am great as a part of a team and can also work independently when required. I am ready to be challenged in order to grow and improve in my IT career.
